After reading a couple articles on Net Art Anthology, they altered my point of view about creating net art, specifically hypertext art. The articles helped me understand the importance of the visual interface in this form of art. The visual appearance has always been a controversial aspect of this method of art which always turned me off from being engaged with this form of art. As I learn more about net art and the importance of being faithful to cliché and old school styles of visuals, I am more able to see the potential behind this approach to the visual aspects of the art.
 This kind of art wants to address social issues in the modernized societies; however; the issues that are being dealt with still have roots in a sick and immature culture. The culture has not improved as fast as technology has changed over past 50 years. That’s the reason now I see how the old-style visuals are a good match with the topic.
For the first piece, the piece RENT A NEGRO by Damali people of color. I liked the way the artist represented the idea in a commercial website to display how we deal with the topic of race. Even the exaggeration coming from sentences used all around the website looks real as you attempt to see if the credit card links works or how can you subscribe in the email list. This is a good reminder that although we like to think the time of racism is over, the sick culture of racism still living under the skin of the society. It is a time we cannot express our racist opinions in public but the way we think and try to separate our groups in society or ignoring people of color means we only act as modernized racists. Many try to act nicely but in their minds still wish to mistreat people of other races and build barriers. We want them for our pleasure and our comfort as it is mentioned in the piece: I need a negro because I need to learn more about a negro, I need a negro because I want to have one in my party. Even the emphasis on the word negro is to emphasize on our racist way of using language!

The second piece, MY BOYFRIEND CAME BACK FROM THE WAR by Olia Lianila, based on the date of creation, is a unique approach of personal story telling through net art. It makes a strong impression on the viewer by having a nonlinear form of storytelling. The viewer couldn’t predict what would be shown after every click and with every click the piece is divided into smaller pieces. It reminds me how a relationship is like a fragile glass and if it break into pieces you would never be able to put it back together. As mentioned in the Anthology “My Boyfriend Came Back from the War highlights the parallels and divergences between cinema and the web as artistic and mass mediums, and explores the then-emerging language of the net.” 
The aesthetic behind the old black and white images make the art piece more related to the dark side of the war and create distance. The distance is not just physical. Indeed, the main consequences of the war are the distances between belief systems and the emotions of people.
The repetition all across the art piece, and the splitting of the screen into small or even blank pieces, induces a sense of absurdism which is injected into the viewer’s perception of the art work. It seems the artist struggles to share much feeling with us. Truly, there is a lot to say but there is no language to be able to express it.  All those unspoken thoughts piled up on another and there is no way to put it into words. It recaps the feeling many of us has experienced in life. When the distance between two people gets bigger and bigger, the absurdity also becomes bigger and there won’t be any chance to bring back that connection.

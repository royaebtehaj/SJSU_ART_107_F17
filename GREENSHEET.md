Course Description
------------------
This semester's Art 107, Advanced Projects in Digital Media Art, will be an exploration in working of Internet technologies. The principal goal of this class will be to learn and build a competency with JavaScript as a medium for art. The class will explore a number of technologies including client side and server side libraries for the creation of internet based art. This class will introduce experimental JavaScript with a focus on conceptual and creative processes using open source technology while addressing contemporary uses in artistic production. Students are required to have completed Art 75 as a prerequisite for this class.

Learning Outcomes

###### LO1: Produce work in line with contemporary art practices.
###### LO2: Present created work in a professional manner.
###### LO3: Generate meaningful human-computer interactions.
###### LO4: Complete original projects exploring the visual and conceptual language of code.
###### LO5: Demonstrate knowledge of the works of some of the most important internet artist and projects.
###### LO6: Think critically about the Internet as a technology.
###### LO7: Present completed artworks in individual and group exhibitions.

Grading Policy and Rubric
-------------------------

Classroom Protocol
------------------

###### There are four main individual projects for this course (in addition to smaller assignments). On workshop days (see the course outline chart for the dates), students should come to class with their in-progress projects and hard-drives ready to work. If you have your own laptop and prefer to use that for your projects, bring it to class with you for the workshop days.

###### Students must meet the deadlines for their projects. No late projects will be accepted. On Idea + concept days (see the course outline chart for the dates) students should bring notes, storyboards, sketches, charts, and material that they have used to do research on the specific topic and concept that you are interested in for their project.

Participation
-------------

###### Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers on their work is mandatory. Remember that 20% of your grade is based on your participation in class and you are expected to actively participate in such discourses as they are some of the most important sections of our class. Your brief written summary of your discussion comments will be due to the instructor at the end of each Presentation day and will be evaluated for demonstrated thoughtfulness and understanding of key concepts and issues.

###### Sleeping in class, texting, and looking at your Facebook or any other activity unrelated to class will also have impact on your participation grade. You are responsible for the missing material if you fall asleep in class.

###### On Presentation days you must be able to explain and give a clear presentation of your work, research, and concepts. If you have a hard time talking in front of a crowd or remembering your points, use a notebook, powerpoint, sketches or bullet points for your presentations.

###### For certain readings that I will be assigning in this course you are required to post one paragraph (400 word) response or a video with 4-5 sentences to our class blog. Those who simply summarize what they have read will not receive any points for their responses. You are asked to think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading. I consider these small assignments as part of your class participation. See the course outline chart for deadlines for these responses.
